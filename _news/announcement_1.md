After 30 days in Cebu City, I have returned to London. I will be in London until January, when I hope to have my Filipino visa approved to return. 

#### Some stuff I did

<ul>
    <li>Conducted x4 workshops / dig security trainings with groups </li>
    <li>Met and networked with participants in Manila, Cebu City, Iloilo City, rural parts of Cebu</li>
    <li>Observed events, group meetings, everyday stuff, local politics spaces, local TV taping with partners</li>
    <li>Karaoke, flirt with the idea of trying balut </li>
</ul>
