I am a [PhD researcher](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/mik-brough) in the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London, working as part of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Cyber Security for the Everyday](https://royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday/current-cdt-researchers/). The CDT is an interdisciplinary doctoral centre for research in cybersecurity, with researchers in cryptography, systems security, and the qualitative/quantitative social sciences. 


My research is ethnographic in nature - meaning that I both interview people and embed myself socially/physically within the spaces I study. I am not alone in this endeavour, as I am part of an amazing [Ethnography Group](https://rikkebjerg.gitlab.io/ethnography-group/people/).


My work explores the digital security practices and perceptions of climate activists in different risky political contexts. My work aims to get at the social, cultural and political dynamics that frame groups' technological choices. Rather than studying cryptographic technologies through a social lens, I study the social first - building our understanding of cryptography *from the ground up*. My doctoral research is linked to the EPSRC-funded interdisciplinary project [Social Foundations of Cryptography](https://social-foundations-of-cryptography.gitlab.io/team). I am supervised by [Dr. Rikke Bjerg Jensen](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/rikke-bjerg-jensen) and [Professor Martin Albrecht](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/martin-albrecht), an ethnographer and a cryptographer respectively.


I have spent the last year working on this project in the UK, with the passage of the Public Order Bill Amendments of 2023 providing the backdrop (findings forthcoming). I am currently continuing to work in the UK, but am also exploring these dynamics in the Philippines, with the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 providing the context. I am currently conducting remote interviews for this project in preparation for two research visits to the Philippines - one in the summer of 2024 and a second and much longer visit in the winter/spring of 2025. I will also be attending COP. 


I have quite a decent grasp of things like computer networking (of which I am currently a TA), cryptography, and programming/stats (mostly Python, though I can mess around in R quite well, and C less so - I am also a TA for Python). I have previously published in other areas of qualitative social research in academia and the private sector, hence the two publications on family planning. This work was part of an anthropological project at the University of Oxford, where I was employed as a research assistant. 


I completed my MSc in Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford in 2021 under the supervision of [Dr. Ina Zharkevich](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ina-zharkevich). I also have a BA from McGill University, during which time I worked many jobs and volunteered with a number of advocacy groups in Montr√©al. I also care a lot about things that are not strictly digital rights/surveillance related such as: harm reduction, cooking education, language education, the Special Olympics (rhythmic gymnastics), migration, and of course the climate. I also worked as a chef for eons, full time for a while, but otherwise in conjunction with other activities. I grew up in southern Ontario, but tend to split my time between London and southern Italy.
