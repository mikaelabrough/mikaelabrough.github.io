I am a [PhD researcher](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/mik-brough) in the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London, working as part of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Cyber Security for the Everyday](https://royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday/current-cdt-researchers/). The CDT is an interdisciplinary doctoral centre for research in cybersecurity, with researchers in cryptography, systems security, and the qualitative/quantitative social sciences. 

#### Research Area

My work explores how members of environmental social movements navigate their information security in politically sensitive contexts. To do this, I take a multi-sited, engaged ethnographic approach in both the Southern Philippines (PH) and the United Kingdom (UK). This approach involves formal and informal interviews, embedded observation through extended fieldwork, and generally working with participants in ways that they feel benefit them. 

I am not alone in the pursuit of ethnography in information security, as I am part of an amazing [Ethnography Group](https://rikkebjerg.gitlab.io/ethnography-group/people/). Overall, this work stresses the complexity of information security research in relation to social movements, and raises questions about how scholars can develop security *in context*, *from the ground*. See abstract [here](https://mikaelabrough.github.io/projects/1_project/)

I am supervised by [Dr. Rikke Bjerg Jensen](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/rikke-bjerg-jensen) and [Professor Martin Albrecht](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/martin-albrecht), an ethnographer and a cryptographer respectively. My doctoral research is related to, but not funded by, their EPSRC-funded interdisciplinary project [Social Foundations of Cryptography](https://social-foundations-of-cryptography.gitlab.io/team). My work is funded through a EPSRC studentship associated with the CDT. 

#### Current Work

I spent 2023-2024 working on this project in the UK (findings forthcoming). I am now exploring these dynamics in the Philippines. The Philippines has a prominent environmental movement and is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be an environmental human rights defender. I recently visited Cebu (and other areas of the southern Philippines) for a preliminary research trip. I will be returning for extended fieldwork in January. My work in the Philippines is a formal collaboration between myself, local universities in PH and environmental advocacy groups.

#### Etc.

I also like to do things outside my thesis. I am a teaching assistant for computer networking, intro to cryptography, and programming/statistics (mostly Python, though I can mess around in R quite well, and C less so). During an RA stint at the University of Oxford, I worked in other areas of qualitative social research, hence the two publications on family planning. 

I completed my MSc in Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford in 2021 under the supervision of [Dr. Ina Zharkevich](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ina-zharkevich). I have a BA from McGill University. I worked as a chef for ages, full time for a while, but otherwise in conjunction with other activities. I grew up in southern Ontario, but tend to split my non-fieldwork time between London and southern Italy. 

Can collaborate professionally in English and Italian. Can hold a conversation in French and Tagalog.
