I am a [PhD researcher](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/mik-brough) in the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London, working as part of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Cyber Security for the Everyday](https://royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday/current-cdt-researchers/). The CDT is an interdisciplinary doctoral centre for research in cybersecurity, with researchers in cryptography, systems security, and the qualitative/quantitative social sciences. 


My research is ethnographic in nature - meaning that I both interview people and embed myself socially/physically within the spaces I study. I am not alone in this endeavour, as I am part of an amazing [Ethnography Group](https://rikkebjerg.gitlab.io/ethnography-group/people/). In the case of my doctoral research, these spaces are those relevant to climate activism - protests, meetings, trainings, community centres, workshops, and the many moments in-between. My work explores the digital security practices and perceptions of climate activists in different political contexts. While I am a digital security researcher, my work aims to get at the social, cultural and political dynamics that frame groups' technological choices. Rather than studying cryptographic technologies through a social lens, I study the social first - building our understanding of cryptography *from the ground up*. My doctoral research is linked to the EPSRC-funded interdisciplinary project [Social Foundations of Cryptography](https://social-foundations-of-cryptography.gitlab.io/team).


I have spent the last year working on this project in the context of the UK, with the passage of the Public Order Bill Amendments of 2023 providing the backdrop for such an exploration (findings forthcoming). I am currently continuing to work in the UK, but am also working on exploring these dynamics in the context of the Philippines, with the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 providing the backdrop for such an exploration. I am currently conducting remote interviews for this project in preparation for two research visits to the Philippines - one in the summer of 2024 and a second and much longer visit in the winter/spring of 2025. I will also be attending COP. 


I have previously published in other areas of qualitative social research in academia and the private sector, hence the two publications on family planning. This work was part of an anthropological project at the University of Oxford, where I was employed as a research assistant between my MSc and the start of my PhD. I am involved in some other security-related socio-technical side projects that I will not name as they are ongoing. 


I am supervised by Dr Rikke Bjerg Jensen and Professor Martin Albrecht, an ethnographer and a cryptographer respectively. In addition to many years of self-teaching since high school, the first year of the CDT is dedicated to taught modules in cybersecurity, and so I have quite a decent grasp of things like computer networking (of which I am currently a TA), cryptography, and programming/stats (mostly Python, though I can mess around in R quite well, and C less so - I am also a TA for Python).

I completed my MSc in Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford in 2021 under the supervision of Dr. Ina Zharkevich. I also have a BA from McGill University, during which time I worked many jobs and volunteered with a number of advocacy oriented groups in Montreal. I also care a lot about things that are not strictly digital rights/surveillance related, and devote time to causes and campaigns involving: harm reduction, cooking education, language education, the Special Olympics (rhythmic gymnastics), migration, and of course the climate. I also worked as a chef for eons, full time for a while, but otherwise in conjunction with other activities. I grew up in southern Ontario, but tend to split my time between London and southern Italy.
