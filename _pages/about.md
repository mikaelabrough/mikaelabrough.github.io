I am a [PhD researcher](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/mik-brough) in the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London, working as part of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Cyber Security for the Everyday](https://royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday/current-cdt-researchers/). The CDT is an interdisciplinary doctoral centre for research in cybersecurity, with researchers in cryptography, systems security, and the qualitative/quantitative social sciences. 

#### Research Area

My research is ethnographic and participatory in nature - meaning that I both interview people and embed myself socially/physically within the spaces I study. I am not alone in this endeavour, as I am part of an amazing [Ethnography Group](https://rikkebjerg.gitlab.io/ethnography-group/people/).


My work explores the digital security practices and perceptions of climate activists in different risky political contexts. From the grassroots to the transnational, my work aims to understand the social, cultural and political dynamics that frame groups' technological choices. Rather than studying secure/cryptographic technologies through a social lens, I aim to study the social first - building our understanding of security *from the ground up*. I am supervised by [Dr. Rikke Bjerg Jensen](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/rikke-bjerg-jensen) and [Professor Martin Albrecht](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/martin-albrecht), an ethnographer and a cryptographer respectively. My doctoral research is linked to, but not funded by, their EPSRC-funded interdisciplinary project [Social Foundations of Cryptography](https://social-foundations-of-cryptography.gitlab.io/team). My work is funded through a EPSRC studentship associated with the CDT. 

#### Current Work

I have spent the last year working on this project in the UK, with the passage of the Public Order Bill Amendments of 2023 providing the backdrop (findings forthcoming). I am currently continuing to work in the UK, but am also exploring these dynamics in the Philippines. I have conducted remote interviews in the Philippines and am currently on the first of two research visits to Cebu. I will also be attending [COP29](https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop) in Azerbaijan. 

#### Etc.

I also like to do things outside my research area. I am a teaching assistant for computer networking, intro to cryptography, and programming/statistics (mostly Python, though I can mess around in R quite well, and C less so). During an RA stint at the University of Oxford, I worked in other areas of qualitative social research, hence the two publications on family planning. 


I completed my MSc in Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford in 2021 under the supervision of [Dr. Ina Zharkevich](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ina-zharkevich). I have a BA from McGill University, during which time I worked and volunteered with a number of advocacy groups in Montr√©al. I also care about things that are not strictly related to digital rights/surveillance -- harm reduction, cooking education, language education, the Special Olympics (rhythmic gymnastics), and refugee protections. I worked as a chef for ages, full time for a while, but otherwise in conjunction with other activities. I grew up in southern Ontario, but tend to split my time between London and southern Italy. 

Can collaborate in English, Italian, and French.
