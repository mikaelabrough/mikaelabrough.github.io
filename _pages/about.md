I am a PhD researcher in the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London. My research explores the digital security practices and perceptions of environmental activists operating in higher-risk political contexts. In particular, I am interested in examining how culturally specific conceptualisations of security frame the cryptographic decision-making processes of advocacy groups. I have previously published in other areas of qualitative social research in academia and the private sector.
