I am a [PhD researcher](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/mik-brough) in the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London, working as part of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Cyber Security for the Everyday](https://royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/studying-here/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-cyber-security-for-the-everyday/current-cdt-researchers/). The CDT is an interdisciplinary doctoral centre for research in cybersecurity, with researchers in cryptography, systems security, and the qualitative/quantitative social sciences. 

#### Research Area

My research is ethnographic, participatory, and qualitative in nature - meaning that I both interview people and embed myself socially/physically within the spaces I study. I am not alone in this endeavour, as I am part of an amazing [Ethnography Group](https://rikkebjerg.gitlab.io/ethnography-group/people/).

My work explores how members of environmental social movements navigate their information security in politically sensitive contexts. Rather than prioritising technological solutions, I study the social first -- building our understanding of security *from the ground up*. One of the main ways I do this is by showing how (information) security is a function of cultural, political and social conditions. I am doing this in two countries - the Philippines and the UK. My ultimate aim is to understand secure systems through the lived experiences of those who explicitly rely on them.

I am supervised by [Dr. Rikke Bjerg Jensen](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/rikke-bjerg-jensen) and [Professor Martin Albrecht](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/martin-albrecht), an ethnographer and a cryptographer respectively. My doctoral research is related to, but not funded by, their EPSRC-funded interdisciplinary project [Social Foundations of Cryptography](https://social-foundations-of-cryptography.gitlab.io/team). My work is funded through a EPSRC studentship associated with the CDT. 

#### Current Work

I spent 2023-2024 working on this project in the UK (findings forthcoming). I am now exploring these dynamics in the Philippines. The Philippines has a prominent environmental movement and is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be an environmental human rights defender. I recently visited Cebu (and other areas of the southern Philippines) for a preliminary research trip. I will be returning for extended fieldwork in January. My work in the Philippines is a formal collaboration between myself, local universities in PH and environmental advocacy groups.

#### Etc.

I also like to do things outside my thesis. I am a teaching assistant for computer networking, intro to cryptography, and programming/statistics (mostly Python, though I can mess around in R quite well, and C less so). During an RA stint at the University of Oxford, I worked in other areas of qualitative social research, hence the two publications on family planning. 

I completed my MSc in Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford in 2021 under the supervision of [Dr. Ina Zharkevich](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ina-zharkevich). I have a BA from McGill University. I worked as a chef for ages, full time for a while, but otherwise in conjunction with other activities. I grew up in southern Ontario, but tend to split my non-fieldwork time between London and southern Italy. 

Can collaborate professionally in English and Italian. Can hold a chat in French and Tagalog.
