Last year I wrote a couple of thousand words about the different ways in which existing work looks at how risk influences perceptions of secure messaging. This literature is quite diverse and challenging to synthesise, spanning HCI, technical security, cryptography, critical security, Science and Technology Studies (STS), and surveillance studies. I presented these words at a 2023 STS confernence organised by [STS Italia](http://www.stsitalia.org/?lang=en) in Bologna. A couple critiques from the audience stood out:

1. What about this existing data speaks to the self-perception of people in so-called risky social and political contexts? 
2. How are self-perceptions represented, and can they even be represented through boiler-plate qual and quant methodologies? 
3. Could these be scientific projections of what *we* assume about other people's levels of risk? 

In reality, the questions were a lot more sophisticated than this but I admit I do not speak STS well. 

For some clarity, the literature on risk and secure messaging tends to divide people into high and low risk designations (particularly in security studies, HCI, and sociotechnical work). Low risk refers to people who are not going to be directly harmed by their information security practices - what people tend to think of as the 'everyday person'. High risk people are thought to be the opposite - typical examples include: journalists, activists (my area and hence the motivation for the review), politicians, terrorists. What my work initially did was to review the results of studies that looked at high and low risk groups. Now I have rewritten the paper to look at some of the assumptions baked into this binary, and some do the broader epistemologies of these fields. 

This is the most recent abstract of the article -

>*A major focus of cryptography revolves around ensuring secure messaging, which involves end-to-end encrypted communication between individuals and groups, primarily to protect privacy from surveillance (e.g., platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal). This paper explores the interdisciplinary research on secure messaging, delving into the underlying paradigms that shape scholarly discourse. I focus on two key questions: How do scholarly assumptions about scientific inquiry influence understandings of secure messaging and its associated risks? And how do scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds perceive the epistemological and moral dimensions embedded in counter-surveillance practices? This article discursively explores and reviews three distinct paradigms within the field of secure messaging: the positivist paradigm, the constructivist paradigm, and the 'risk-oriented' paradigm. Within the latter paradigm, I challenge conventional categorisations of individuals as 'high' and 'low' risk in information security and advocate for an `everyday security' understanding of these spaces.*

While this article started out as a literature review, the current form is more of a critical review. I will be presenting this paper again soon at [Looking for Everyday Security: A Cross-Disciplinary Workshop](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/institute-of-advanced-studies/news/2024/jan/cfp-looking-everyday-security-cross-disciplinary-workshop). The simply-stated issues that I explore in terms of this binary (as articulated in the paper by interweaving conventional review with a look at scholarly morality/epistemology) are as follows: 

**Speaking about others** Many studies that distinguish between high-risk and low-risk people ascribe these labels to the communities they study. The binary is an academic construct that does not tell us much about how people navigate and negotiate risk in relation to their digital security. While there are many academic articles I could cite to support this, the easiest way is to speak from experience. If you interview someone who engages in what outsiders would call *risky activities* or lives in a so-called *risky political climate*, it is rare that they will frame their life in these terms. For most people, what seems risky to somebody else is likely normal to them. In addition, living in these spaces does not always lead to the adoption of protective mechanisms, -- for some, uncertainities and fear might maniest in generalised hope, rathern than concrete practices. 

**Speaking about the everyday** The concept of everyday suggests that in certain contexts, security practices become integrated into daily life routines, even amidst perceived risks. People's sense of danger may differ from researchers' perspectives, leading to less explicit forms of security that are absorbed into everyday life. The idea of 'security by compartmentalization' (Ermoshina and Musiani, 2022) highlights how people, with multiple identities and roles, hav different security desires across various aspects of their lives. 

**Speaking about adversaries** The high-risk/low-risk binary in understanding security is based on assumptions about the urgency and motivation of potential adversaries, rather than the nature of the adversary itself. High-risk people are assumed to have a strong adversarial model - in which they respond to concrete threats from government agencies, law enforcement, abusive partners, and so on. In this assumption we seem to forget about various conceptions and threat and where they can originate from. There are imagined threats, whereas some aversion to threat is garnered through experience. We have to take into account how experiences of risk are framed and processed differently by different people. For example, the kinds of threats that different police forces pose to protesters vary within the same society and between countries. While protesters in the UK fear being confronted at a live rally or having an action suppressed, Filipino activists fear being known to the police as extremists, encompassing pervasive ‘slow violence’ (Nixon, 2011) that escalates. These two things simply are not the same, but would be lumped together in the current literature that considers police a monolithic adversary against activists.

I will link to the article as soon once I know that I can. In other boring literature review news, I am currently embarking on the big one for my thesis...
