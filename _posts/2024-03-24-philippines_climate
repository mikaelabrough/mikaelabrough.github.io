Typically, in ethnographic research, we seek depth 'in place' - a long-term, situated understanding of a singular, geographically delimited place. As anthropology has evolved, the 'field' has had to change to accommodate movement, globalism and cross-cultural social phenomena - the 'field' can be a lot of things these days  

My dissertation aims to combine depth of place with multi-sitedness, meaning that I use ethnographic methods in several geographically dispersed locations around a common theme - climate activism/information security. This is really at odds with pure anthropology, which seeks rich and complex explanations of a culture *only* in and of itself. Comparison is an analytically complicated tool in ethnography, and generalisation is almost always seen as a simplification. The pursuit of multi-sitedness confronts me with a methodologically complicated landscape. In particular, pursuing multi-sitedness with climate activists (who are not part of the same transnational group) in the UK and the Philippines requires some thought. 

Before thinking about combining sites, there is a more immediate question - why the Philippines? I have been asked this question by virtually everyone I have interviewed from the Philippines so far, and also by everyone I know in the research world. There really are a number of reasons why the Philippines is an absolutely ideal place to explore climate activism and digital security. I have explored these reasons with some of the participants who have shared their insights with me remotely, and so these contextual insights really come from them, not from me.  

#### Collaboration and Scale

There is no single dominant environmental group in the Philippines; instead, there is a diverse range of medium and small groups that often work together. Numerous coalitions facilitate this collaboration, with some activists belonging to 5 or even 10 groups/coalitions.

Why is there not one big group? According to one participant, there is an interest in unifying the landscape to have a stronger voice, but groups often lack resources and similar priorities. Issues of scale also come to the fore, with some groups preferring local battles and others taking on transnational (regional or global) issues. Therefore, with a variety of smaller groups working together, there is no one way to 'do information security', leading to ad hoc security practices that do not always map onto each other. As someone interested in networks, the complexity of this network, particularly in terms of scale, is fascinating. 

### Environmental social movements encompass a lot of other things besides 'the climate'

The variety of ways that activism manifests in the Philippines, what is called deem ‘activism beyond the streets’. Despite the fact that interview participants have either organised or been to protests before, they all emphasised that protest is a part of a more complex image of activism, and this complexity is a result of unusual safety concerns.

One participant defined climate activism in the Philippines as encompassing three rough categorisations. The first one is the “activist who goes to the streets.” The second is “activists who are more artistic or express themselves on the policy level.” And then there are land defenders, who In this participant told me “is different than the other types.”
To be a land defender is to participate in the act of ‘immersion’ – usually on anti-extractivism campaigns. This sometimes involves working with rural communities (farmers, fisherfolk, and indigenous groups) facing eviction from ancestral lands as a result of large corporations buying this land ‘over the head’ of the community, with the intention of extracting timber and coal, or converting land into plantations (e.g. for palm oil). Not only people who immerse themselves are land defenders though - the definition is broader. There are five types of land defenders in the Philippines, roughly indigenous peoples, farmers/agricultural workers, activists, lawyers/judges, and conservation officers. 

Land defending through immersion is perceived by the public and
government as a radical communist activity, making it the most dangerous form of activism
in terms of arrest and death. In the Philippines, there is an armed wing of the Communist Party that is considered a violent terrorist group (New People’s Army Rebellion). Land defending can be considered a communist activity, since it involves advocating for workers rights and anti-capitalism. Being affiliated with the NPA is to be considered a rebel, another term for a terrorist. Therefore,
being a land defender carries a risk of being ‘red-tagged’, a process that Ferdinand Marcos
introduced during periods of martial law. To be red-tagged is to be added to a government
database, and then arrested / killed outside of the law.

Other forms of activism (e.g., mass mobilisations, smaller protests, political activism, creative activism) also take on a similar ethos, which is that climate activism is not just ‘for the climate’ but also defends livelihoods, workers, and the connected lives of people and land. Local forms of activism in the Philippines do just that, represent local battles over land. More globalised or transnational groups take on broader, more global level concerns. This makes for a conflicting and complicated social movement, a social movement that is prominent in the Philippines due to the countries vulnerability to climate change. 

### Generalised threat

Despite which types of activism they took part in most, interviewees told me that about the
fears associated with activism. The context of this fear is the Anti-Terror Law (ATL) of 2020,
which was a culmination of many years of tightening legislation surrounding extremism.

#### ATL 2020

The 18th Congress passed the ATL in 2020 under Rodrigo Duterte, who expanded the
definition of what it means to be an extremist. The law was petitioned 37 times, making
it the most assailed piece of legislation in Philippines history [5]. Duterte specified in the
definition in response that “advocacy, protest, dissent, stoppage of work, industrial or mass
action, and other similar exercises of civil and political rights” shall not be considered as
terrorist acts only if they do not present a risk to public safety. Therefore, protest is not
illegal (it is a constitutional right) - but the reality is that certain forms of activism are
thought of as terrorism under this new definition. The ATL “made it so that people think
activism is terrorism.“ (P1).  At least 1734 killings of environmental and land defenders took place in a total of 53 countries between 2002 and 2018, most of them occurring in Brazil, the Philippines,
Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Peru (with 77% of land defender killings occurring in these
6 countries)

While police do repress protests, particularity larger ones or ones without permits – there
are more insidious forms of repression that are linked to the ATL, in which targeted killings
or arrests of ‘known extremists’ are subcontracted through middlemen to hired gunmen or
criminal gangs or paramilitary. The killing and arrest of land defenders is a phenomenon borne earlier than the ATL.

#### “Letting the police know you exist”

All other forms of protest and advocacy are also dangerous but are not considered to be
extremist. The risks that protesting carries are related to violent dispersion and “letting the police know that you exist” (P6). Protesting without a permit is grounds for arrest, and involvement in nonviolent direct action (NVDA) can also lead to arrest. Activists in the Philippines generally view being arrested as undesirable, given the extreme danger posed by the state, and this undermines
public trust in institutions that could assist them in the event of arrest. This erosion of trust
could potentially undermine the entire movement.

While one might assume that people who take part in less radical forms of activism act in
less secure ways, this is not true in the Philippines. All activists, regardless of methods used,
fear their safety. P4 explained that this is because there is little trust in the ‘rules’ of how
the government normally behaves, and the consequences can be extreme.

### Reliance on digital networks

While many groups meet in-person when activists live close by, a significant amount of
organising is done online. This is exacerbated by the fact that some groups work regionally
or nationally, spanning many different islands. P6 claimed that the Philippines is a “country
12of digital citizens.” P5 emphasised that even in rural areas, Internet connection in the
Philippines is a top priority, but speeds are not always great. This is because 2 main
companies monopolise telecommunications, and charge a lot for data. People tend to use
Facebook Lite, which allows them to not incur data fees - thus making Facebook the most
dominant social media. In 2023, Statista claims that Filipinos spend 9.14 hours online daily
- the third highest country in the world. In terms of mobile phones, the Philippines topped
the list in terms of usage. Filipinos spend at least five hours and 31 minutes a day going
online through their phones. Therefore, the amount of digital literacy is quite high.

Finally, groups meet both in person and online.

### Lastly, climate change matters in the Philippines.
