Securing Converged Technologies: Insights from Subject Matter Experts          

__Abstract__ 

The convergence of existing and emerging technologies are increasingly reshaping contemporary capabilities of states, organisations, and society with significant risks and opportunities for cyber security. Based on research with 20 subject matter experts primarily from within the cyber security sector, this report examines the role of technology convergence, its impact upon cyber security, and potential policy responses to identifying and mitigating technology convergence in the domain. We present a series of findings on the challenges of identifying technology convergences for cyber security, how technology convergence operates across broader technology ecologies, and how engagement with a range of actors in order to build expert communities is essential to addressing and mitigating the impact of technology convergence for cyber security.
